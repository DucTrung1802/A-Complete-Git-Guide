# A Complete Git Guide

## Cheat Sheet

## 1. What is Git ?
**`Git`** is a free and open source software for distributed version control: 
- Tracking changes in any set of files.
- Using for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development.

## 2. Git Repositories
A **`Git repository / Git repo / repo`** is a virtual storage of your project. It allows you to save versions of your code, which you can access when needed.
There are 2 types of **`Git repository / Git repo / repo`**:
- **`Remote repository / Remote repo`**: A repository for sharing among many people and arranged on a server (Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps).
- **`Local repository / Local repo`**: A repository arranged on a machine, for a single person to use.

## 3. Git components

<br>

- **`remote branch`**: A series of **`snapshot`** on the server.
- **`remote-tracking reference`**: A copy of **`remote branch`** on your local machine.
- **`local branch`**: A series of **`snapshot`** on the local machine.
- **`index / staging area`**: The preparation space for a new **` snapshot`**.
- **`workspace`**: The current state of your project on local machine, may contains `committed files and uncommitted files` or `committed files` only.
- **`stash`**: a temporary local **`snapshot`** of the **`workspace`**, used to save the current state of the **`workspace`** while you work on another branch.
